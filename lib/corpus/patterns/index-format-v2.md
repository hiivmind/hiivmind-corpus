# Pattern: index-format-v2 — index.yaml Strict Schema

## Purpose

`index.yaml` replaces LLM-generated prose (`index.md`) as the source of truth for corpus entry metadata. It is a structured, machine-queryable file optimized for deterministic pre-filtering via `yq`. The LLM no longer reads unstructured prose to find relevant files — instead, `yq` filters candidates by tags, keywords, category, and summary regex before the LLM applies semantic judgment.

`index.yaml` is written by the source-scanner agent during `build` and updated differentially during `refresh` and CI. It is the authoritative record of what the corpus contains and the metadata needed to answer navigate queries efficiently.

## When to Use

| Skill / Workflow | Role of index.yaml |
|------------------|--------------------|
| `hiivmind-corpus build` | Written by source-scanner agent; rendered into index.md as final step |
| `hiivmind-corpus refresh` | Differentially updated — stale flags set, new entries added, deleted entries removed, then re-rendered |
| `hiivmind-corpus navigate` | Read for yq pre-filtering before LLM semantic judgment; freshness check compares config.yaml SHA |
| CI refresh workflow | Structurally updated without LLM (SHA diff, stale flagging); triggers external agent for LLM re-scan |

## Relationship to index.md

`index.md` is a **render artifact** produced deterministically from `index.yaml`. It is never hand-edited and never LLM-generated at render time. The same `index.yaml` always produces the same `index.md`, regardless of which agent executes the render.

- `index.yaml` — source of truth, machine-queryable, written/updated by build/refresh
- `index.md` — rendered output, human-readable, regenerated whenever `index.yaml` changes

Navigate checks for `index.yaml` first (v2 flow with yq pre-filtering). If absent, it falls back to `index.md` prose scanning (v1 behavior). Existing corpora with only `index.md` continue to work unchanged.

## Relationship to config.yaml

Source metadata — repository URL, branch, SHA tracking (`last_commit_sha`), timestamps (`last_indexed_at`), and source coordinates — lives in `config.yaml`. It is **not duplicated** in `index.yaml`.

- Navigate reads `config.yaml` for freshness checks (indexed SHA vs live repo SHA)
- CI reads `config.yaml` for source coordinates (repo, branch) to compute file diffs
- `index.yaml` entries reference their source via the `source` field (source ID), which joins to `config.yaml`

## Schema Definition (Strict)

```yaml
entries:
  - id: "polars:user-guide/expressions/basic-operations.md"
    source: polars
    path: "user-guide/expressions/basic-operations.md"
    title: "Basic Operations"
    summary: "Arithmetic, comparisons, Boolean operations, counting unique values"
    tags: [expressions, arithmetic, comparisons, boolean]
    keywords: [add, subtract, multiply, divide, filter, unique, n_unique]
    category: reference
    content_type: markdown
    size: standard
    grep_hint: null
    headings:
      - anchor: "arithmetic"
        title: "Arithmetic Operations"
      - anchor: "comparisons"
        title: "Comparison Operators"
    links_to:
      - "polars:user-guide/expressions/casting.md"
    links_from:
      - "polars:user-guide/getting-started.md"
    frontmatter: {}
    stale: false
    stale_since: null
    last_indexed: "2026-03-13T10:00:00Z"

meta:
  generated_at: "2026-03-13T10:00:00Z"
  entry_count: 119
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Canonical identifier: `{source_id}:{path}`. Join key to graph.yaml |
| `source` | string | yes | Source ID from config.yaml |
| `path` | string | yes | Relative path within source |
| `title` | string | yes | Human-readable title — from frontmatter `title`, first heading, or filename |
| `summary` | string | yes | 1-2 sentence description of content. LLM-generated during build |
| `tags` | string[] | yes | Curated search facets — from frontmatter tags, LLM-assigned, or extraction. Controlled vocabulary where possible |
| `keywords` | string[] | yes | Auto-extracted significant terms from content body. Broader than tags — includes function names, API terms, domain-specific identifiers |
| `category` | enum | yes | Coarse classifier. Values: `reference`, `tutorial`, `guide`, `api`, `config`, `navigation`, `journal`, `unknown` (CI placeholder — replaced on LLM re-scan) |
| `content_type` | enum | yes | File format. Values: `markdown`, `yaml`, `json`, `text`, `rst` |
| `size` | enum | yes | `standard` or `large`. Large = file exceeds 1000 lines |
| `grep_hint` | string | no | For large files: suggested grep/search command with `FILE` placeholder, e.g. `grep -n "^## " FILE`. Null for standard files |
| `headings` | object[] | no | Sub-file anchors with `anchor` (slugified) and `title` fields |
| `links_to` | string[] | no | Outbound links — entry IDs this file references. From extraction |
| `links_from` | string[] | no | Inbound links — entry IDs that reference this file. Populated during full build by cross-referencing all entries' `links_to`. **Not updated by CI differential refresh** — requires full LLM-powered build to recompute cross-references accurately |
| `frontmatter` | object | no | Preserved original YAML frontmatter from source file — all keys by default. Corpus authors can configure exclusions in `config.yaml` extraction settings. Pass-through for domain-specific queries |
| `stale` | boolean | yes | CI flag: content changed since last LLM-powered scan. Default: false |
| `stale_since` | datetime | no | When the entry was marked stale. Null if not stale |
| `last_indexed` | datetime | yes | When this entry was last scanned by the source-scanner agent |

## Meta Section

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `meta.generated_at` | datetime | When the index was last written |
| `meta.entry_count` | integer | Total entries in the index |

Source-level tracking (SHA, timestamps, repo coordinates) remains in `config.yaml` where it already exists. No duplication.

## yq Query Patterns

```bash
# Tag search
yq '.entries[] | select(.tags[] == "expressions")' index.yaml

# Keyword search
yq '.entries[] | select(.keywords[] | test("filter"))' index.yaml

# Category filter
yq '.entries[] | select(.category == "reference")' index.yaml

# Summary regex
yq '.entries[] | select(.summary | test("arithmetic|comparisons"; "i"))' index.yaml

# Combined: tag + category
yq '.entries[] | select((.tags[] == "expressions") and .category == "reference")' index.yaml

# Heading search
yq '.entries[] | select(.headings[].title | test("Arithmetic"; "i"))' index.yaml

# Forward link traversal
yq '.entries[] | select(.links_to[] | test("casting"))' index.yaml

# Backlink discovery
yq '.entries[] | select(.links_from[] | test("getting-started"))' index.yaml

# Find stale entries
yq '.entries[] | select(.stale == true)' index.yaml

# Count entries per category
yq '.entries | group_by(.category) | .[] | {(.[0].category): length}' index.yaml
```
